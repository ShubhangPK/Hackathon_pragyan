# Hackathon_Pragyan
App to be made at the hackathon

App idea:
To provide the details of the stadium that is free for playing of the sport to be hosted at the specific places.


Differences from Weather app:
1) Streamlines the runtime availability of free places to play the sport
2) It is going to show output based on bus number inputted
